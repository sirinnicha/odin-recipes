    <p>Thai Chicken Curry Noodles or Khao Soi is a creamy coconut curry noodle based dish originating in Northern Thailand. It's a dish which combines common Thai ingredients and flavours such as shallots, lemons (or limes), red curry paste or ground chillies in oil with meat into a curry-like soupy sauce, served on egg noodles and topped with crispy fried egg noodles. Traditionally, Khao Soi is served with chicken; however variations of the dish can also be made with beef, pork and even tofu.</p>

        <li>2 Thai Shallots</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp Red Curry Paste</li>
        <li>1/2 Tsp. Turmeric Powder</li>
        <li>2 Cups Coconut Milk</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tsp. Palm Sugar</li>
        <li>340g Dried Egg Noodles</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Warm cooking oil in a pan on a medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add some oil, garlic and shallots, stir for about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Then, add the red curry paste and turmeric. Stir and simmer the mixture until the paste darkens slightly. This should take roughly 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of coconut milk slowly, stirring to blend. Allow it to simmer for a few minutes with the sauce bubbling until a layer of oil sits on the surface.</li>
        <li>Follow by adding the chicken drumsticks and simmer on a medium to low heat until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Then, add the remaining cup of coconut milk and repeat step 4 until oil rises to the surface again.</li>
        <li>Next, add the chicken stock and bring the sauce to a simmer before adding the soy sauce and sugar to taste. Reduce the heat to keep the sauce warm.</li>
        <li>Boil a large pot of water and cook the egg noodles according to their instructions. Once cooked, drain and rinse them with cold water</li>
        <li>Serve the noodles into 4 bowls and cover with the warm Khao Soi curry sauce and chicken pieces. Optionally, garnished with fried noodles, coriander, sliced onions and lemon wedges.</li>
